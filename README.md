# CrypList

Cryplist is an app that I followed to learn more about swift and swiftUI as well as adding a few touches of my own.

The app is a fully functioning crypto currency viewer and portfolio.

The app makes use of MVVM, data persistance (CoreData), concurrency (Combine), and an external API (coingecko).
